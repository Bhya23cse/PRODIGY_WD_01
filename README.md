- **Hover Effects**: Hover over the menu items to see the color change.
- **Scroll Effects**: Scroll the page to see the navigation bar change its style.

## Code Overview

### HTML

The HTML structure includes a navigation bar with a logo, navigation links, a color mode toggle button, and a menu toggle button for smaller screens.
